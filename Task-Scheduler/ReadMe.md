I built a GenAI-powered daily task scheduler using Amazon PartyRock, focusing on realistic time-blocking based on Parkinson’s Law. The app dynamically adjusts schedules based on the user’s focus intensity and suggests extra tasks only if time permits. I used prompt engineering to shape LLM behavior and PartyRock’s no-code interface to quickly iterate and test the user experience.
