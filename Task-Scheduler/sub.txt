“Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.”
  — Cyril Northcote Parkinson, 1955

It means.
If you give yourself 8 hours to do something, it will take 8 hours — not necessarily because it needs that long, but because your mind adjusts to the time limit. But if you set a tight, focused deadline, you often get the same quality work done in much less time, say 4 hours or sometimes even 2 hours.
So, while the exact quote you mentioned might not be a direct citation from Parkinson, the underlying principle is derived from his theory — and it's been echoed by many productivity experts like:
    Tim Ferriss (in The 4-Hour Work Week)
    Brian Tracy (in Eat That Frog)
    Even Elon Musk, who’s known for compressing work timelines aggressively.
